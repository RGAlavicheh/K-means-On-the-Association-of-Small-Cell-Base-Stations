# K-means Unsupervised Machine Learning
simulation of the paper "On the Association of  Small Cell Base Stations with UAVs  using Unsupervised Learning" 

paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8746456)https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8746456

In this simulation, we attempted to replicate Figure 2 and Figure 3 from a specific paper. We also conducted additional simulations to further explore the topic.
